<p class="descrp responsive">In this project we delt with modifying a photograph and its layers to create a graphic
   image while including famous quotes, or in this case lyrics, to the image. I really enjoyed 
  working on this project as it was one of the first big projects I worked on in the Design
program here at Eastern. </p>

<p class="descrp responsive">For this Project I worked with book cover design and was tasked with making a correctly
  sized book cover for the movie or book of my choice. I decided to work with the Disney movie 
  "Atlantis The Lost Empire" because I knew the movie well and had lots of ideas. Figure ground 
  was the main task that was required for the project. I decided that using the skyline of "Atlantis"
  in the brow of the main character on the front made a good example for the task of the project.
  This project although tough at times proved to come out as a success.

<p class="descrp responsive">For this project our task was to create a company design for a product and mock up the 
  packaging for said product. I went with skate wheels as my product calling my company
  "Not So Normal" and having a focus on creating a community of skaters that felt as if
  they lacked a gorup around them. This mock up of the products packaging also came with ads
  for this said product. I created Ads for the product with the task of creating something
  professional and gripping for any one who would veiw the product. This project was 
a learning experience for creating mockups both physical and digital.

<p class="descrp responsive">In this project for a photography class the task was to take detailed shots of some 
  forms of architecture around the surrounding area. In Spokane I was able to find some
  pillars attached to city building with some detailed designs carved into them. Finding
  these interesting carvings I photographed them as well as some sculptures on a downtown 
  church. These detailed shots were taken and color corrected bringing more of the color
  to life and providing some depth to the image. These photos and some others we have worked 
  on have really shown the power of the programs we use and made for some interesting photos 
  and work.
